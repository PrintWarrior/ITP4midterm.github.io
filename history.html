  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>Siayan (Siay-Ayan) got its name from the leader of the Subanen tribe that inhabited the area, The name of his Wife was Siayan and the leader’s nickname was Ayan. This Subanen couple was greatly loved, adored and respected by his followers because of his bravery in fighting against their Moro enemies who came to invade the place. When the settlers started coming to the area, they inquired who was the leader of subanen tribe. The Subanen answered “Siayan”, a combination of the Wife’s name and the Husband’s nickname. From that time on, the pioneering settles called the place “SIAYAN”.</p>
